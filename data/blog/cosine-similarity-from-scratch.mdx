## Background
When we design RAG Architecture, the most important part is how we transform our exisiting data into vectors using embedding process. Let say we have a collection of journals and we want those collections to be context in addtion to our prompt, we need select the relevant data within those journals. But what if the relevant data included into several documents, 

## Type of similarity
+ Cosine similarity
+ Euclidean Similarity
+ Jaccard Similarity
+ Dot Product

## Cosine Similarity Formula

## Hands On 
+ Transform text  into vector
+ Saved vector to SQLITE
+ Query embedding to vector
+ Calculate cosine distance
+ Result

## Conclusion

## Reference
