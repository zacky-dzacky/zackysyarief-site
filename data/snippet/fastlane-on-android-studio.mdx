We can use fastlane to make automation build process and even deploy android app from local to firebase or google play console

## Install Fastlane

First thing first instal fastlane for your specific OS. follow this instruction [fastlane](https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/android/setup/")

After installation and you got `fastlane` command on your terminal. Next init your project with fastlane:

```
fastlane init
```

Then, after initialization, you will get `fastlane` folder within your android project.

## Init Firebase CLI

Make sure Firebase-CLI is installed on your devices. Follow this instruction [link](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#install-cli-mac-linux)
After installation, init your android project with:

```
firebase init
```

## Deploy android app to firebase app distribution

Follow this steps from build app to deploy to firebase app distribution:

- Open `AppFile` in fastlane folder
- Add script build app

```
gradle(task: 'bundle', build_type: options[:build_type])
```

- Add Script to deploy to app distribution

```
firebase_app_distribution(
    app: `your_app_name`,
    groups: `app_distribution_group`,
    android_artifact_path: `aab_path`,
    firebase_cli_token: `token`,
    android_artifact_type: `build_variant`,
    release_notes: `note_to_firebase_app_distribution`
  )
```

That's All. Make local deployment faster using Fastlane.
