Migrating gradle sytling from groovy to Kotlin. No more than 2 steps.

- You need to create folder in a same row with app. We cannot create it from android studio, in order to create it we need to go to folder and create `buildSrc`
- create a file name within this folder, and giving it name `build.gradle.kts`. Sync and you got this below

That’s all what you need to start using Kotlin DSL. Kotlin DSL gives you more flexibility dan kotlin consiceness to you.

Happy kotlin. Cheers
